## Time-series Forecasting

# Project Overview
In this project, I have worked with two machine learning models - ARIMA and SARIMA - to predict the future number of passengers in a flight. 

# Code and Resources Used 
**Python Version:** 3.7  
**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels  
**Kaggle:** dataset

# Preprocessing

* I looked for the different components of the time-series data such as seasonality and trend by using decomposition.
* Checked for stationarity of the time-series using ADF test and rolling statistics.
* Used log and differencing to make the data stationary.
